# spring-eureka-server

### This repo is the basic boilerplate for the Netflix's Eureka Server - without error*

Notes On Eureka Server:
#### 1.The server has an endpoint on which clients can connect to. That endpoint is /eureka.
#### 2.The port that the client connects to by default is 8761 so the servers port should be configured to that.
#### 3.The URL that the server takes can be configured in application.properties with eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone
